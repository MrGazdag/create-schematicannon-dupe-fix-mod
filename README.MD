# Schematicannon Dupe Fix mod for MC 1.20.1

This is a basic mod that fixes a dupe bug found in Create version 6.0.8. The bug has been fixed in version 6.0.9,
but 6.0.9 will not be released for MC 1.20.1. This mod is based on [this commit](https://github.com/TerraFirmaGreg-Team/Core-Modern/pull/246/commits/9b03ea6f0d79cd9293f07de2239931eddd3fd900)
from the TerraFirmaGreg mod.
